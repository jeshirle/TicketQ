In this folder you will find the Test packages.
In this folder you will find packages, Test and Ticket.
The Ticket folder is the same as in the main code, includes Ticket and TicketList.
The Test folder contains 2 executable tests, Create.java and Display.java.
Both pull from the Ticket codes proving the concept works. 
Create.java will allow for user input and display the newly created ticket. 
The functionality of the while loop is in place to prove the concept of unique ticket numbers.
Display.java is a simple run program and will display three new tickets.
The only information given to the ticket was Name, Department, Status and Notes. 
The program generates the remaining fields.
